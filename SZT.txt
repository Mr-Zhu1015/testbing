1. Introduction
The aim of my doctoral research was to explore the psychological and physiological correlates 
of aikido practice. 
Aikido is a martial art of Japanese origin, rooted in ancient martial and philosophical 
characteristics. It is also a combination of physical activity, self-defense technique, philosophy 
and educational procedure, the training of the body, the mind and the spirit (Stevens, 2001; 
Szaotome, 2007 ; K. Ueshiba, 1984; M. Ueshiba, 2002). The name aikido can be interpreted as 
„the way of spiritual harmony”, where „ai” means harmony, connection, „ki” refers to energy, 
force and „do” is a method, a way (Szaotome, 2007). A prime aim of aikido is the attainment 
of harmony and peace (K. Ueshiba, 1984). The practice of aikido is typically performed in pairs, 
with the aim to defend oneself without causing harm to the attacker, instead to create a harmony 
of movements (no competitions are held in aikido). Most important characteristics of aikido’s 
movements are: stability; the evasion from the line of attack, blending with the motion of the 
attacker and redirecting the force of the attack, based on moving from the centre of the body 
using circular and spherical movements (Szaotome, 2007; M. Ueshiba, 2002; Westbrook & 
Ratti, 2003). The practicing of aikido has been spreading both in Hungary and the world in 
general (About Aikido | Aikikai Foundation, 2019; Magyar Aikido Kerekasztal, 2016).
Aikido practice can also be considered a regular physical activity (usually exercised 2-3 times 
a week, for 90 minutes). Regular physical activity has proven positive effects on health 
protection and improvement, it decreases the risk of physical and mental illnesses and 
contributes to the development of the health-related physical fitness of its practitioners 
(Bouchard et al., 2012; Hardman & Stensel, 2009; Lox et al., 2010; Physical Activity 
Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2018), but for these effects to appear a sufficient amount of 
suitable physical exercise is indispensable (American College of Sports Medicine, 2017; 
Haskell et al., 2007). 
Due to its characteristics, aikido can theoretically be considered a recreational physical activity 
as well. The requirements for an optimal-quality recreational physical activity are that the given 
physical exercise should be voluntary, controlled by the individual, it should have cultural and 
educational aspects as well, provide pleasure, i.e. it should have a positive effect on the actual 
mood of the practitioner, should ensure the possibility of a life-long participation and generate 
flow experience in its practitioner (Ábrahám, 2010; Bánhidi, 2016; Caldwell & Witt, 2011; 
Kovács, 2004; Köteles, 2018; Lox et al., 2010; Outley et al., 2011; Pigram, 1983; Rogers, 2000).

Being an eastern movement form, aikido can be characterized by the following features: (1) its 
main objective and focus is spiritual self-development, (2) its foundation is the cooperation and 
the unity of body and mind, (3) it can be considered a mindful activity, (4) its primary goal is 
to help practitioners to better function as a whole, in harmony with themselves, others, and the 
world and (5) all these for a long term, offering the possibility of life-long exercise (D. H. K. 
Brown, 2013; Lee et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2009; Schmalzl et al., 2014; Stevens, 2001; Szaotome, 
2007; K. Ueshiba, 1984; M. Ueshiba, 2002). The regular practice of aikido can in theory 
develop practitioners level of spirituality (Wheeler & Hyland, 2008), body awareness (Mehling 
et al., 2009), mindfulness (Bishop et al., 2004; Mehling et al., 2009; Zgierska et al., 2009) self compassion (Neff, 2011) and subjective well-being (Keyes et al., 2002).
According to both its founder (Ueshiba Morihei), masters and its practitioners, the regular 
practicing of aikido exerts an improving effect on body and soul (Stevens, 2001; Szaotome, 
2007; K. Ueshiba, 1984; M. Ueshiba, 2002).
However, it is questionable how these effects materialize factually, in a measurable manner.
2. The psychological and physiological correlates of aikido practice: a systematic review 
(Study 1)1
2.1. Aim
This systematic literature review aims to summarise the current knowledge about the 
physiological and psychological benefits of aikido training.
2.2. Method 
Databases including SPORTDiscuss, PsycINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE, and ScienceDirect were 
searched by following the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews (Liberati et al., 2009). 
The search term was “aikido” in title, abstract, keyword.
The search was restricted to articles in English language, academic journals, and articles with 
an abstract. Reviews, meta-analyses, conference papers, case-studies, books, book chapters, and 
theses/dissertations, were excluded. Further, studies in which aikido was not the independent 
variable, or the intervention was not a traditional (original) aikido training, were also excluded; 
 1 Publcated work: Szabolcs Z., Köteles F., Szabo A. (2017). Physiological and psychological benefits of aikido 
training: a systematic review. Archives of Budo, 13, 271-283
similarly like studies focusing on the enhancement of training’s efficacy, or detailed description 
of the techniques. A total of 20 articles met the criteria for inclusion set for the review.
2.3. Brief summary of the results 
The reviewed studies vary in their focus and study design, and some of the studies are 
methodological questionalbe (e.g. they worked with too short intervention periods, there are no 
comparative or control groups). The findings of the here reviewed studies may be considered 
preliminary, or exploratory, although they show promising results. and certainly worth 
following up. Studies were typically psychologically or physiologically focused
Based on the summary of physiological research, one of the most robust results is that a longer 
aikido training is beneficial in the healing of scoliosis for boys, more than conventional 
corrective exercises (Mroczkowski, 2013; Mroczkowski & Jaskólski, 2006, 2007). It can be 
said that it is likely that (already a five-month long) aikido training enhances the flexibility of 
the upper extremities in young adults, compared to other physical activities (Huang et al., 2008). 
Studies also show that among postmenopausal women aikido improves balance stability 
(Bazanov et al., 2015, 2017). Findings also suggest, that length of aikido training is associated 
with better functional efficacy in male aikido practitioners (Boguszewski et al., 2013). More 
exploratory and less robust studies also show that in comparison to Shotokan karateka, 
practitioners of aikido seem to be at higher risk of head/neck, upper extremity and soft tissue 
injury (Zethar et al., 2005), and that aikido practice does not really increase aerobic capacity 
compared to aerobic exercise (Jasnoski et al., 1987), and does not improve the grip strength of 
the two hands compared to other martial arts and combat sports (Vodicka et al., 2016).
The studies concerning the psychological correlates of aikido practice are methodological less 
robust, their results therefore can be considered rather preliminary, or exploratory. A finding of 
a more robust research shows that aikido practice has a positive impact on mindfulness among 
adult practitioners (Lothes II et al., 2013). The practice of aikido in adults also appears to be 
associated with a lower level of ego-orientation as a goal-orientation in sport (Gernigon & Le 
Bars, 2000) and is associated with better anger-control in contest situations less (Pieter & Pieter, 
2008). Among adolescents we can see, that practitioners of aikido show lower levels of physical 
aggression and social, behavioural problems compaired to other martial arts and combat sports 
(e.g.thai-/kickboxers), and that in their case the choice of aikido practice may be related to 
socio-economical status (Vertonghen and al., 2014). Aikido seems to promote task-orientation 
and reduce ego-orientation among children and adolescents (Gernigon & Le Bars, 2000; 
4
Vertonghen et al., 2014). The findings also suggest that it may be unlikely that a short period 
of aikido training moulds self-control (Delva-Tauiliili, 1995), self-esteem, anxiety, and anger 
expression (Foster, 1997) and aggressive (Delva-Tauiliili, 1995) or Type A behaviour (Jasnoski 
and al., 1987). In addition, the results of exploratory research (qualitative and with a very small 
sample size) suggest that a longer period of aikido training might have positive effects on 
psychotherapeutic work (Faggianelli & Lukoff, 2006), and have particularly beneficial effects 
for woman by helping them to enjoy the full expression of physical self and focus on functional 
aspects of their bodies and emotions (Halik & Kochan- Wójcik, 2015; Noad & James, 2003).
2.4. Discussion 
Overall, we can say that some principles of aikido, are partly seem to be confirmed by research, 
like increased awareness (increased mindfulness), a peaceful non-competitive atmosphere (less 
ego-orientation), immersion in technical development (greater task-orientation). Important 
movement characteristics of aikido also seem to have benefical effect on the body of 
practitioners: like the role of stability (better balance stability), soft spherical movements, calm 
and controlled rolls, flexibility in movement (better upper felxibility, functional efficiency, 
positive effects on scoliosis). But other essential elements of aikido, such as nonviolence, or 
internal peace, however, has not been verified by research, as conflicting results have been 
obtained (e.g. regarding aggressive behavior). Finally, many potential beneficial aspects of 
aikido training (steeming form it’s practice and philosophy) have not been explored. So further 
exploratory and replicative research in the future is definitely warranted.
The studies presented in our systematic research project a global image that aikido practice has 
positive psychological and physiological benefits, which is in accord with the anecdotal surmise 
revolving around this martial art.

3. The physiological effects and correlates of aikido practice: investigating the 
cardiovascular load and physical fitness of practitioner (Study 2)2
3.1. Aim
The aim of this research was to explore the physiological effects and correlates of aikido 
practice and to examine the extent to which (supplemented by the results of previous research 
on this topic) regular aikido training meets the optimal criteria and recommendations for 
recreational physical activity (American College of Sports Medicine, 2017). Therefore we 
assessed the cardiovascular load of aikido workouts as well as several aspects of participants 
health-related physical fitness, and also compared the latter to reference values. 
Our hypotheses were as follows: aikido workouts represent a favorable cardiovascular load: 
they represent movement predominantly in aerobic heart rate zone; compared to the reference 
values aikido practitioners show better cardiovascular fitness (maximum oxygen uptake), more 
favorable body composition (ie, optimal body mass index, lower body fat percent and higher 
muscle percent), better grip strength and achieve better results on the lateral side bending 
flexibility test and ont the sit and reach flexibility test; we also assumed that there is no 
difference between the grip strength of the two hands of aikido practitioners.
3.2. Method 
Participants were male aikido practitioners (n = 38, 36.3 ± 9.28 years). Cardiovascular load of 
conventional aikido workouts was measured by continuous individual heart rate monitoring 
(Firstbeat Technologies Ltd., Jyväskylä, Finland) during the entire workout (minimum 3 
workouts / person). For the adequate calculating of participants training heart rate zones we 
also calculated and took into consideration individual anaerobic thresholds (Ekkekakis et al., 
2008). Then we calculated how much time participants spent in the aerobic and anaerobic 
exercise zone (Garber et al., 2011) . 
Participants health-related physical fitness was measured with using international standards and 
protocolls: maximum oxygen intake (by using spiroergometer and cycle, and conducting a 
maximal graded exercise test), body composition (Omron Healthcare Co., Japan) lateral side 
bending flexibility test (EUROFIT; Olja & Tuxworth , 1995), sit and reach test (EUROFIT; 
Olja & Tuxwort, 1995) and hand grip strength (EH101, Deyard, China). Measured value of

each measured variable of each individual was compared to the age and gender adjusted mean 
value of a Hungarian sample (Ihász et al., 2015, 2016), and in the absence of this to international 
reference values (EUROFIT ; Consider & Tuxworth, 1995).
3.3. Brief summary of the results 
The measurement of cardiovascular load of traditional aikido workouts showed that aikido 
training has a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system: participants spent about one-third 
of their total training time in the aerobic range and about 16% in the anaerobic.The physical 
fitness measurements showed, that compared to the respective reference group, individuals 
practicing aikido on a regular basis were characterized by better cardiovascular capacity 
(maximal oxygen uptake), favorable bodyfat percent and body mass index, and showed better 
lateral side bending values; however, they were inferior with respect to the sit and reach test, 
body muscle percent, and hand grip strength. We found no differences between the strength of 
the two hands.
3.4. Discussion 
From these results, together with the results of previous research (which showed a positive 
association between aikido and better balance stability; Bazanov and al., 2015, 2017; and 
enhanced felxibility of the upper extremities; Huang and al., 2008) we concluded that aikido 
represents a recreational exercise with considerable health protective effects, and that aikido 
practiced 2-3 times a week for 90 minutes suit the ACSM recommendations with the exception 
of resistance training (American College of Sports Medicine, 2017).
4. Acute psychological effects of aikido training: investigating affect and flow experience 
(Study 3)3
4.1. Aim
Our next research aimed to explore the acute psychological effects of aikido practice . Our aim 
was to find out whether the practice of aikido meets the criterion of recreational physical 
activity, according to which it is joyful, i.e. it pushes the current state of mood in a positive 
direction (Bánhidi, 2016; Kovács, 2004; Rogers, 2000), and to find out if it is able to generate

8
flow experience in its participants (Abraham, 2010; Lox et al., 2010), and to thereby 
scientifically examine the truth of anecdotal narratives about the positive psychological effects 
of aikido.
To examine these, we measured the volume of the change in positive and negative affect caused 
by aikido training, as well as the extent of flow experienced during training, in a self-reported 
way, using questionnaires.
Our hypothesis was that aikido practitioners report greater positive affect and less negative 
affect after training than before training, and that they experience flow during training, and that 
these changes will be more significant in experienced practitioners, compared to less 
experienced ones.
4.2. Method 
Practitioners of aikido (n = 53; 85% men, 37.2 ± 10.56 years) completed the Positive and 
Negative Affect Schedule (Gyollai et al., 2011) immediately before and after training and the 
Hungarian Flow State Questionnaire (Magyaródi et al., 2013) immediately after the training. 
Participants participated in the survey at least 3 times, so a total of 257 data sets were analyzed.
4.3. Brief summary of the results 
We found that aikido training has acute psychological benefits (increased positive affect and 
decreased negative affect) regardless of belt rank. A further result is that aikido training is 
associated with flow experience, and this perceived flow experience is relatively independent 
of the beneficial changes in emotional states resulting from aikido training. Finally, our results 
also showed that even at lower belt levels practitioners of aikido can be highly absorbed in the 
experience.
4.4. Discussion 
According to our findings, we can say, that aikido meets the criteria of recreational physical 
activity, that it is joyful and that it generates flow experience. Our results are also in line with 
that principle of aikido and other martial arts, that the practitioner should be absorbed in the 
improvement of the technique, in the here-and-now. Our findings also generally support that 
the practice of aikido has acute psychological benefits.

5. The " chronic " psychological correlates of aikido practice: exploring it’s relationship 
with mindfulness, body consciousness, spirituality, self-compassion and subjective well being (Study 4)4
5 .1. Aim
Our fourth research aimed to explore the "chronic" (trait-like) psychological correlates of 
regular aikido practice. We studied the relationship of aikido with psychological characteristics, 
which could possibly be enhanced by aikido practice (according to its philosophy and practice). 
Such characteristics are spirituality (Wheeler & Hyland , 2008), body awareness (Mehling et 
al., 2009), mindfulness (Bishop and al, 2004;. Mehling et al, 2009;.. Zgierski et al, 2009), and 
self-compassion (Neff, 2011). These characteristics originally rooted in Eastern philosophy and 
practice and are shown to contribute to psychological and subjective well-being (Brani et al., 
2014; KW Brown & Ryan, 2003; Ivtzan et al., 2013; Levine & Targ, 2002; Neff, 2011). We 
also investigated the relationship between aikido and subjective well-being (Keyes et al., 2002).
To control for different aspects of aikido practice, we used a physically active control group 
and three comparative groups (from which each can be said to be similar in some aspect to 
aikido).
Our hypotheses were as follows: the aikido group does not differ from the yoga group in the 
level of mindfulness, self-compassion and spirituality, but shows higher values than the other 
groups (judo, ballroom dance, control); the aikido group shows higher value in the level of 
subjective well-being and body awareness compared to the control group and ballroom dance; 
greater aikido experience shows a positive assosiation with higher levels of the studied 
psychological variables; aikido instructors show higher values in the level of the studied 
psychological variables than non-instructors.
5 .2. Method 
In a cross-sectional design pactitioners of aikido (n = 131 , 19.1% female, 36.8 ± 11.06 years), 
yoga (n = 86 , 83.7% female 44.1 ± 10.8 4 years), judo (n = 74 , 23% female 34.1 ± 14, 25 
years) and ballroom dance (n = 87 , 50.6% female, 30.2 ± 13, 08 years), and a physically active 
control group (n = 87 , 70.1% women, 27.6 ± 9.6 4 years) completed questionnaires to assess 
their levels of mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; Simor et al., 2013), body

forms of Eastern origin: A comparative study of aikido, judo and yoga.

awareness (Body Awareness Questionnaire; Emanuelsson et al., 2015; Köteles 2014), self compassion (Self-Compassion Scale; Sági et al., 2013), spirituality (Spiritual Connection 
Questionnaire; Köteles & Simor, 2014) and subjective well-being (WHO Well-Being 
Questionnaire; Susánszky et al., 2006). Groups were compaired with gender, age, education, 
and weekly hours spent with the respective physical activity as covariates.
5 .3. Brief summary of the results 
We found, that the practice of aikido is associated with higher levels of spirituality in 
comparison to ballroom dance, and control, and higher levels of body awareness than control 
group, and that more experience in aikido is connected to elevated levels of well-being, 
mindfulness, body-awareness and self-compassion. 
5 .4. Discussion 
We can make the conclusion, that aikido - as also formulated along its philosophy - is positively 
related to higher levels of spirituality (compared to other forms of exercise), mindfulness (as 
well as other oriental movement forms), body awareness, and higher degree of subjective well being (as well as other physical activities), and may have a beneficial effect on self-compassion.
6. General discussion
The aim of my doctoral research was to explore the psychological and physiological correlates 
of aikido practice.
Our review of previous studies showed that only very few researches had been carried out 
regarding physiological and psychological correlates of aikido, and even these studies were 
characterized by thematic diverseness and methodological heterogeneity and weakness, but 
they also produced promising findings. Based on more robust psychological studies, it can be 
said that, in line with its principles, aikido is associated with increased levels of mindfulness, 
task-orientation, and decreased levels of ego-orientation. The results of physiological research 
concerning aikido show that practicing aikido can help improve scoliosis, upper exremities 
flexibility, and functional efficacy. However, several aspects of aikido, the possible beneficial 
effects stemming from its theory and practice have not been analyzed or the researches 
produced contradictory results.
11
As a result of our research we can conclude that aikido represents a recreational exercise with 
considerable health protective effects, and that aikido practiced 2-3 times a week for 90 minutes 
meets the optimal criteria and recommendations expected from physical activity to maintain 
and improve health, except for the recommendation for resistance training.
Our studies have also shown that aikido training has acute psychological benefits (with an 
increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect) regardless of belt rank, and that 
aikido training is associated with flow experience. Thus, aikido meets the criteria of recreational 
physical activity, that it is joyful and that it generates flow experience.
According to our findings we can as well make the conclusion, that aikido – as also formulated 
along its philosophy - is positively related to higher levels of spirituality (compared to other 
forms of exercise), mindfulness (as well as other oriental movement forms), body awareness, 
and higher degree of subjective well-being (as well as other physical activities), and may have 
a beneficial effect on self-compassion.
Overall, the results of our research presented in this dissertation partially demonstrate the 
beneficial effects of aikido on body and soul, in line with its principles. As a consequence, we 
can state that regular aikido practice is a beneficial, even lifelong practiced recreational physical 
activity.
